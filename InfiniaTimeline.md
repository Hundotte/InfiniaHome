- Idea was conceived in 2012

- InfiniaPress development started (Apr 2016)

- Saddest day of InfiniaPress - delaying of signup launch due to port block by unknown sources (15 July 2016)

- InfiniaPress Signups begin on 16 July 2016 - First person to sign up gets $0.00000000000000000000000000000000069

- Signups were delayed **AGAIN**


- Backend developer of InfiniaPress (@xiurobert) discovers 
a MySQL User configuration bug preventing people from signing up. LOL! 
This was immediately patched on the official server
